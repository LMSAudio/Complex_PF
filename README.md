## Combining Adaptive Filtering and Complex-valued Deep Postfiltering for Acoustic Echo Cancellation 

In this repository you will find examplary results from our ICASSP-submitted paper *Combining Adaptive Filtering and Complex-valued Deep Postfiltering for Acoustic Echo Cancellation*. 

In addition, once our contribution is accepted, we are committed to uploading our implementation such that our results can be reprocuded by interested readers. 


### Audio examples 

Here you will find five different examples produced using the synthetic test dataset provided as part of the ICASSP 2021 AEC Challenge:

#### Example 1
 Unprocessed microphone signal | Residual signal after linear adaptive filter | Real-valued Postfilter | Complex-valued Postfilter
