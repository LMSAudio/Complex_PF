## Combining Adaptive Filtering and Complex-valued Deep Postfiltering for Acoustic Echo Cancellation 

In this repository you will find examplary results from our ICASSP-submitted paper *Combining Adaptive Filtering and Complex-valued Deep Postfiltering for Acoustic Echo Cancellation*. 
In addition, once our contribution is accepted, we are committed to uploading our implementation such that our results can be reprocuded by interested readers. 

### Audio examples 

Here you will find five different examples produced using the synthetic test dataset provided as part of the ICASSP 2021 AEC Challenge > https://github.com/microsoft/AEC-Challenge
