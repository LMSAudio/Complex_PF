## Combining Adaptive Filtering and Complex-valued Deep Postfiltering for Acoustic Echo Cancellation 

Here you can find an implementation of our proposed complex-valued deep postfilter. 

#### How to use: 
1. Make sure all dependencies are installed. You can find the used packages in the file [./git_config.py]
2. To run the code using the provided *dummy* datasets, simply run the file [./git_train.py], which should conduct training, validating and testing using the provided datasets
3. You can run the code using the provided *dummy* datasets [./data/]. The datasets provided are compressed and therefore, one should de-compress the files beforehand. 

The implementation uses several files to separate the different parts of the code: 
1.
